        "1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        "-Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes code into objects, which bundle data and behavior together. It emphasizes reusability, modularity, and abstraction through key concepts like classes, objects, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is a class in OOP?\n",
        "-A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines attributes (data members) and methods (functions) that the objects created from the class will have.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What is an object in OOP?\n",
        "-An object is an instance of a class. It represents a specific implementation of the class with actual values assigned to attributes and access to the class's methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        "-Abstraction hides complex implementation details and shows only the necessary features of an object.\n",
        "\n",
        "Encapsulation is the bundling of data and methods into a single unit (class) and restricting access to some of the object's components (e.g., using private variables).\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        "-Dunder (double underscore) methods are special methods in Python with names like __init__, __str__, __len__, etc. They enable operator overloading and define behaviors for built-in functions and operations.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP.\n",
        "-Inheritance allows a class (child/subclass) to inherit attributes and methods from another class (parent/superclass). It promotes code reuse and the creation of a hierarchical relationship between classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        "-Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It enables the same operation to behave differently on different classes (e.g., method overriding and overloading).\n",
        "\n",
        "8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        "-Encapsulation in Python is achieved using access specifiers:\n",
        "\n",
        "Public (var)\n",
        "\n",
        "Protected (_var)\n",
        "\n",
        "Private (__var) Though not strictly enforced, these conventions control access and modification of class attributes and methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is a constructor in Python?\n",
        "-A constructor in Python is defined by the __init__() method. It is automatically called when a new object is created and is used to initialize the object's attributes.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
        "-Class method (@classmethod) takes the class as its first argument and can modify class state.\n",
        "\n",
        "Static method (@staticmethod) doesn't take class or instance as its first argument and is used for utility functions related to the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is method overloading in Python?\n",
        "-Python does not support traditional method overloading. Instead, it can be mimicked using default arguments or *args/**kwargs to allow different numbers of parameters.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
        "-Method overriding allows a subclass to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
        "-The @property decorator in Python allows you to define methods that can be accessed like attributes. It is commonly used for getters/setters.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
        "-Polymorphism enhances flexibility and scalability by allowing the same interface to work with different data types or classes, making code more general and reusable.\n",
        "\n",
        "15. What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
        "-An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated and may contain one or more abstract methods. It's defined using the abc module and the @abstractmethod decorator.\n",
        "\n",
        "16. What are the advantages of OOP?\n",
        "-Code reusability through inheritance\n",

        "Easier maintenance and debugging\n",
        "\n",
        "Improved scalability\n",
        "\n",
        "17. What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n",
        "-Multiple inheritance means a class can inherit from more than one parent class. Python supports this, and the method resolution order (MRO) determines which parent method is used if there is a conflict.\n",
        "\n",
        "18. What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n",
        "-Class variable is shared across all instances of the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "Instance variable is unique to each object of the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "19. Explain the purpose of __str__ and __repr__ methods in Python.\n",
        "-__str__() is meant to return a human-readable string representation of the object.\n",
        "\n",
        "__repr__() is meant to return an unambiguous string that can be used to recreate the object, mainly for developers/debugging.\n",
        "\n",
        "20. What is the significance of the super() function in Python?\n",
        "-The super() function is used to call a method from the parent class. It's commonly used to call the parent class’s constructor (__init__) from a subclass.\n",
        "\n",
        "21. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        "-The __del__ method is a destructor in Python. It is called when an object is about to be destroyed and is used to release resources like file handles or database connections.\n",
        "\n",
        "22. What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?\n",
        "-@staticmethod: Doesn’t take self or cls as the first parameter; it behaves like a regular function inside a class.\n",
        "\n",
        "@classmethod: Takes cls as the first parameter and can modify class-level attributes.\n",
        "\n",
        "23. How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n",
        "-Through method overriding. A subclass can override a method from its parent, and the overridden method will be called based on the object’s actual type, not the reference type.\n",
        "\n",
        "24. What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n",
        "-Method chaining allows multiple method calls to be made on the same object in a single statement, by returning self from each method.\n",
