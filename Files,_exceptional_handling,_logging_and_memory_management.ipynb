        "1. What is the difference between interpreted and compiled languages?\n",
        "Interpreted languages execute code line-by-line at runtime (e.g., Python), while compiled languages translate code into machine language before execution (e.g., C++), which typically results in faster execution.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is exception handling in Python?\n",
        "Exception handling allows programs to catch and manage runtime errors gracefully using try, except, else, and finally blocks.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What is the purpose of the finally block in exception handling?\n",
        "The finally block contains code that is always executed, regardless of whether an exception occurred or not, often used for cleanup tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What is logging in Python?\n",
        "Logging is the process of recording messages or events that happen during program execution, useful for debugging and monitoring.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        "The __del__ method is a destructor that gets called when an object is about to be destroyed, used for cleanup actions like closing files or releasing resources.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. What is the difference between import and from ... import in Python?\n",
        "import module loads the entire module, while from module import function imports specific items directly, allowing direct usage without the module prefix.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. How can you handle multiple exceptions in Python?\n",
        "You can handle multiple exceptions using a tuple or multiple except blocks:\n",

        "The with statement ensures that files are automatically closed after the block is executed, even if an exception occurs.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is the difference between multithreading and multiprocessing?\n",
        "Multithreading runs multiple threads in the same process (shared memory), while multiprocessing runs separate processes (independent memory), making it better for CPU-bound tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What are the advantages of using logging in a program?\n",
        "Logging helps track issues, monitor applications, debug problems, and maintain logs without interrupting program execution.\n",

        "11. What is memory management in Python?\n",
        "Memory management in Python involves allocating and releasing memory automatically using reference counting and garbage collection.\n",

        "Efficient memory management ensures optimal performance, prevents memory leaks, and maintains system stability.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. What is the role of try and except in exception handling?\n",
        "The try block contains code that might raise an exception, while the except block defines how to handle specific exceptions.\n",
        "\n",
        "15. How does Python's garbage collection system work?\n",
        "Python uses reference counting and a cyclic garbage collector to detect and clean up unused objects automatically.\n",
        "\n",
        "16. What is the purpose of the else block in exception handling?\n",
        "The else block runs if no exception occurs in the try block, useful for code that should only run when the try block succeeds.\n",

        "\n",
        "19. What is the importance of closing a file in Python?\n",
        "Closing a file ensures that resources are released and data is properly written to disk, preventing data corruption or memory leaks.\n",
